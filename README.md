# WAT

wat stands for WhatsAppTerminal, it is a cli for communicating with my wwebjs whatsapp server

The server and the cli tool are independent. They are in the same repo just because the server is not intended to contain complex logic, it only exposes the wwebjs library to other clients.

I have separated [server readme](server) and [client readme](client).
